        <h3>Safaricom and the Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges facing our business today is how to create sustainable growth and at the same time leave no Kenyan behind in our growth story. This is why we adopted nine out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to help guide our company into the next phase of its growth.The SDGs are humanity’s shared vision of the actions that we need to take to create growth for everyone to benefit, and thus form a social contract between the world’s leaders and our people. Safaricom was the first Kenyan company to integrate sustainability deep into the core of our every business decision. We are using the SDGs to transform and boost the success of our business and enhance our Transforming Lives agenda.
